# Add all SSH addresses on which constellation will run.
# To  avoid being asked for a password each time, setup SSH keys.
#
# Example:
# computeAddresses=(\
# "odroid@10.72.20.59" \
# "odroid@10.72.21.38" \
#)

# Add all the compute nodes and their context separated with a space
# Nodes will ONLY process Activities with a label matching one or more
# indicated contexts
computeAddresses=(\
    "odroid-1 A,B" \
    "odroid-2 A,B" \
)


# Target context will always be "target", this device will display results from ALL contexts
targetAddress="self"

# Source can produce Activites for multiple contexts
sourceAddress="self A,B"
